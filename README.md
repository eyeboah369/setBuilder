**Simple Flask app for Discrete Math Topic of Sets**

This project utilizes [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)

**INSTALLATION**

You will need to install *Flask* to your individual machine to run the application on localhost.
cd into the cloned project environment and create, then enter the *venv*:

To create the virtual environment:
`python3 -m venv env`

Then enter the env:
`source ./env/bin/activate`

**ENABLING VENV ABSTRACTS DEV ENVIRONMENT FROM SYSTEM FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE**

Then run the pip command to install Flask (pip can be installed and explained [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

`python3 -m pip install flask flask_wtf pyobjc boto3`

Navigate to your top directory and run:

`python3 -m flask run`

The development server will run and you can then navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` or localhost to access the app.
